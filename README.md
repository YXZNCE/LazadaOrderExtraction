# Lazada PH Order Extraction

A simple .NET console application that uses **PuppeteerSharp** to scrape order details like price, quantity, name from Lazada Philippines.  
this collects order data across multiple pages, and can export it to an Excel file for easy viewing or bookkeeping.

## Features

- **Manual Login**: Allows you to log in via a real browser window (headless = false).  
- **Scrapes All Pages**: Automatically navigates through pagination, collecting each order.  
- **Item-Level Refund Detection**: Skips or flags refunded items so they donâ€™t inflate totals.  
- **Exports to Excel**: Writes out item details (name, price, quantity, date) and calculates grand total.  

## Requirements

1. [.NET 6+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet) installed.  
2. [PuppeteerSharp](https://github.com/hardkoded/puppeteer-sharp) via NuGet:
   ```bash
   dotnet add package PuppeteerSharp
   ```
3. [ClosedXML](https://github.com/ClosedXML/ClosedXML) (if you plan to export to `.xlsx`):
   ```bash
   dotnet add package ClosedXML
   ```

## Usage

1. **Clone/Download** this repository.
2. **Open** the project in your preferred IDE (Visual Studio, Rider, VSCode) or via command line.
3. In **`Program.cs`**, make sure `Headless = false` so you can log in manually:
   ```csharp
   var launchOptions = new LaunchOptions
   {
       Headless = false
   };
   ```
4. **Run** the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
5. A Chromium browser will launch. **Log in** to your Lazada PH account.  
6. **Press any key** in the console once you are logged in. The scraper then navigates to your orders page and collects data.
7. After scraping all pages, **view** the summary in the console.  
8. (Optional) Export the results to an Excel file via a helper method such as `ExportToExcel(allOrders, "output.xlsx")`.

## Additional Notes

- **Timeouts**: if pages take longer to load, adjust the `Task.Delay(...)` or use `WaitForSelectorAsync(...)` to make sure content is fully loaded.  
- **Data Privacy**: the code logs into Lazada using your credentials, so keep your code private and handle any saved credentials securely.
